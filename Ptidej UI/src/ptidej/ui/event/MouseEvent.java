 * I use my own MouseEvent. There is a good reason to this.
 * I want my framework to be graphic-framework independent.
 * Thus, I don't want the class ptidej.ui.Canvas to depend on
 * a specific implementation of AWT or SWT MouseEvent.
 * What happens is that an implementation specific Canvas
 * class (see for instance ptidej.viewer.AWTCanvas) wraps the
 * ptidej.ui.Canvas class and creates an instance of
 * ptidej.ui.event.MouseEvent from an instance of
 * java.awt.event.MouseEvent (resiprocally for SWT).
