A few notes on how to install CHOCO:

0) First, you should install Claire v3.2.32 properly. 
   Then, you should install Choco v1.3.18 or above properly

1) A sound directory organization is the following

.../choco/
         /v1.318
         /benchs
         /test
.../iceberg/
           /v0.5
           /test
           /init.cl

2) edit the Claire configuration file (init.cl) and change 
the directory on the line defining the CHOCO module, in case the version 
number is not correct. 
choco :: module(source = ChocoInstallationDir / "v1.318",  //this version number can be upgraded
by
choco :: module(source = ChocoInstallationDir / "v1.322",  
in case you use version 1.322 (no yet coded at the time when this explanation was written).

3) run Claire from the XXX directory with the following shell command

claire -s 3 3 -m ice

you get the interpreter prompt and you can now run choco/iceberg programs
ice>

From there, you can either type-in  your own programs or load some of the benchmarks. 
For instance, you can load the benchmarks modeling the queens problem
with
  choco> load("test" / "t_match")
  eval[0]> ---- [load CLAIRE file: test\t_match]
and solve a sample problem with the all different constraint
  choco> testAllDiff1(6)
Be sure to adjust the verbosity to the desired level before solving problems:
  choco> system.verbose := 0
will print out little information, while
  choco> system.verbose := 5
will output much tracing information

For code examples, look at the functions defined in the test/*.cl files

In order to run all benchmark examples in interpreted mode, you can load the icetest module:

claire -s 4 4 -m icetest
icetest> allIceTestsInterpreted()
and the benchmarks suite will go


4) In order to have a faster CHOCO/ICEBERG interpreter (which is much nicer for larger problems), you should compile the library.
In order to do so, type at the shell prompt
  claire -s 4 4 -cm ice
You are compiling the Claire module to C++. This should produce a run-time program containing all the CHOCO/ICEBERG primitives
linked with a Claire interpreter.

5) In order to run the benchmark suite as fast as possible, first
compile ice, then compile icetest
In order to do so, type at the shell prompt
  claire -s 4 4 -cm icetest

This will produce an executable called icetest. When you run
  icetest -s 5 5
you get a prompt
  icetest>
just type in
  icetest> allIceTests()
and the benchmarks suite will run
