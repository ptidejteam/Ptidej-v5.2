A few notes on how to install PaLM:

0) First, you should install Claire properly. 
   PaLM v1.324 works with Claire v3.2.52 (http://www.choco-constraints.net/download/CLAIRE%20v3.2.52.zip)
   Second, you should install Choco properly.
   PaLM v1.324 works with Choco v1.324 (http://www.choco-constraints.net/download/chocov1.324.zip)
   Third, you should install Iceberg properly.
   PaLM v1.324 works with Iceberg v0.5 (http://www.choco-constraints.net/download/icebergv0.5.zip)

1) A sound directory organization consists in having the following files in a XXX directory (on my computer, XXX is "c:/devclaire3/PaLM")

init.cl     (claire configuration file)
install.txt (this file: installation notes)
readme.txt  (a table of contents of the PaLM library)
release.txt (a release history of PaLM)
license.txt (the PaLM License)

v1.324/
    (the place for the Claire sources of PaLM)
	p-model.cl       : the object-oriented basis and global tools        
	p-domain.cl      : handling lazy enumerated domains                  
	p-explain.cl     : explanation related tools and interface           
	p-variables.cl   : variable definitions for PALM                     
	p-constraints.cl : arithmetic constraint definitions for PALM        
	p-ac4.cl         : constraints in extension à la AC4                 
	p-symbolic.cl    : some symbolic constraints for PALM                
	p-bool.cl        : handling boolean connectors as constraints        
	p-solve.cl       : solving problems in e-cp                          
	palmapi.cl       : application programmer interface (public methods) 
	p-namespace.cl   : transparent connection with choco and ice

v1.324/obj/
    (the place to put all generated C++ files, empty for the moment)

doc/
    (the place for all documentation)
	tutorial-1.cl    : code examples for http://www.e-constraints.net/palm/manual/palm-note-firssteps.html
	tutorial-2.cl    : code examples for http://www.e-constraints.net/palm/manual/palm-note-search.html
    (an online documentation is available at http://www.e-constraints.net/palm/manual.html)


2) You must edit the Claire configuration file (init.cl) and change the directory on the 
   line defining the PaLM module. Replace:

ChocoInstallationDir:string := "." // do set the variable !!
IceInstallationDir:string   := "." // do set the variable !!
PalmInstallationDir: string := "." // do set the variable !!
by
ChocoInstallationDir:string := XXXX // do set the variable !!
IceInstallationDir:string   := XXXX // do set the variable !!
PalmInstallationDir: string := XXXX // do set the variable !!

(use the absolute path for the real name of XXXX, using / as a file separator)


3) run Claire from the XXX directory with the following shell command

  claire -s 4 4 -m palm

you get the interpreter prompt and you can now run palm programs
palm>

Before writing your own PaLM programs, you should test PaLM by launching the palmtest module : 

  claire -s 4 4 -m palmtest

and once in the interpreter launching : allPalmTests()
The whole set of test should pass with a "true" indication. 

From there, you can type-in your own programs. 


4) In order to have a faster PaLM interpreter (which is much nicer for larger problems), you should compile the library.
In order to do so, type at the shell prompt (this instruction supposes that you already have compiled choco with the 
claire/EXTENDABLE_CHOCO:boolean variable - in model.cl - set to true)

  claire -s 4 4 -cm palm

You are compiling the Claire module to C++. This should produce a run-time program containing all the PaLM primitives
linked with a Claire interpreter.

If you want to test the compiled version of PaLM, you should compile palmtest : 

  claire -s 4 4 -cm palmtest

and launch palmtest before launching : allPalmTests()
