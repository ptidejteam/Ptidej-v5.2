MoDeC: an instrumentor, invoker, and meta-model to collect and model
execution traces of Java programs.


MoDeC Architecture/Decomposition in Projects
--------------------------------------------

Projects:

- "MoDeC Bytecode Instrumentation" (and "MoDeC Bytecode
Instrumentation Tests") deals with the instrumentation of the
bytecodes of the Java programs of which a user wants to collect
execution traces (called target Java program).

- "MoDeC Invoker" allows the user to simply calls the instrumented
Java program (i.e., to run the instrumented bytecodes of the target
Java program.

- "MoDeC Metamodel" declares a meta-model of the execution traces
produced by the "MoDeC Bytecode Instrumentation" and provides a
parser to instantiate the MoDeC meta-model to obtain a model of a
given execution trace.

- "MoDeC Solver" (and "MoDeC Solver Tests) defines constaints and
problems to identify occurrences of behavioural and creational
design motifs in models of execution traces.



MoDeC Basic Uses
----------------

Steps to gather execution traces of some target program.

(1) Instrument the bytecode of the target program, using
"modec.util.Instrumentor.instrumentClasses(String)", see examples in
"modec.util.Instrumentor.main(String[])". The input of the
"instrumentClasses" method is a file describing:
    - The path to the byecode classes of the target program.
    - The path to the folder where to store the instrumented bytecodes.
    - The path to the libraries required by the target program (if any).
    - The name of the file of the execution traces.
    - The fully qualified name of the "main" class of the target program.
    - A list of paths to the Java class files to instrument, relative to the first path above.
See for a complete example "MoDeC Bytecode Instrumentation
Tests/Input Files/Evaluation of ArgoUML v0.19.8.txt".

The list of paths to the Java class files to instrument can be
generated using
"modec.tool.helper.ClassFileListGenerator.main(String[])".

(2) Execute the instrumented target program, using
"modec.tool.Invoker.invokeMainClass(String)", see examples in
"modec.tool.Invoker.main(String[])". Running the "Invoker" will
launch the instrumented target program and open a new window. The
new window shows only one button and a text field, used to insert
marks (also called tags) at any user-chosen appropriate moment in
the collected execution traces, for example before and after
executing some particular feature.
