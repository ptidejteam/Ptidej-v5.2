/**
 * This package contains the default implementation of JCT.
 *
 * <h2>Internal references and enclosed elements:</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer} contains four nested classes responsible to contains
 * the enclosed elements and keeping the enclosingElement backlink up-to-date. there are four such
 * classes: {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer.InternalList},
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer.InternalSet},
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer.InternalReference} and
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer.InternalNullableReference}.<br>
 * Those classes may be built only via method factory, in order to comply with Java Generics
 * restrictions.<br>
 * The accesors of those containers call
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElement#updateEnclosingElement(jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer)}
 * which is repsonsible for:
 * <ol>
 * <li>removing the element from the old container,</li>
 * <li>adding the element in the orphan set if the new enclosing element is null, or check that
 * enclosing and enclosed elements are owned by the same root node,</li>
 * <li>updating the enclosing element backlink,</li>
 * <li>and finally, discard the index cached in the path builder.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Those containers are also responsible for discard the index cached in the path builder of any
 * other enclosed element as needed.</p>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Path implementation:</h2>
 *
 * The implementation of Paths is a little complexe, and some "implementation-dependant" value has
 * been used.
 *
 * <h3>Generation:</h3>
 *
 * <p>First, the generation of paths is done using a
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTPathPartBuilder builder}, each element has one, and each attribute of
 * the path is cached within this builder.<br>
 * Index is changed each time the element is moved or each time an element is inserted before in the
 * enclosed element list,
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElement#updateEnclosingElement(JCTElementContainer)},
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElementContainer#discardEnclosedElementsCachedPathPartBuilderIndex(JCTElement)}
 * and the internal reference ensure that.<br>
 * When a path is requested via {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElement#getPath()},
 * {@link jct.test.rsc.jct.kernel.impl.JCTElement#createPathPart()} updates the builder and returned it, after
 * what, the new path part is put at the end of the path to the enclosing element.</p>
