<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p align="LEFT">The Ptidej project (Pattern Trace Identification, Detection, and
Enhancement in Java) has for objectives to design algorithms and to
implement tools to improve the quality of software systems by
promoting the use of patterns at the code-, design-, and
architectural-level.

<p align="LEFT">The research results of the Ptidej project are embodied in the
Ptidej tool suite, this software system. In its current version, the
Ptidej tool allows reverse-engineering object-oriented software
systems and defining and identifying various design patterns, code smells,
and antipatterns. It also allows various quality analyses.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<p align="LEFT">You can import Java class files or source files from 
different programming languages (C#, C++, Java...), either
individually, or in a entitre directory, or in the form of a Ptidej file, which declares a list
of files, then reverse-engineer these files and display
their UML-like models, and call the various analyses.

<ol>
<li> Create a Ptidej file, with extension ".ptidej". The Ptidej file
has the following format:

<pre>
    [Ptidej Project]
    Name = &lt;A name&gt;
    JavaCode = &lt;A directory&gt;;&lt;A directory&gt;;...
</pre>

where:

<ul>
<li> &lt;A name&gt; is a string naming the system to reverse-engineer. </li>
<li> &lt;A directory&gt; is a path (absolute or relative) pointing on
     a directory containing some class files to reverse-engineer.
    The path MUST END with a trailing '/'.
</li>
</ul>

For example:

<pre>
    [Ptidej Project]
    Name = Applet of JHotDraw v5.1
    JavaCode = ../../../JHotDraw v5.1/bin/CH/ifa/draw/applet/
</pre>
</li>

<li> Load the Ptidej file into the Ptidej tool by clicking on the
"Load Project" button and selecting a ".ptidej" file. This will open
a window with a UML-like model of the reverse-engineered class
files. 
</li>

<li> Annotate with the instructions the model of the 
reverse-engineered class files by clicking the "Model Annotator with
Instructions" button in the "Tools" panel.
</li>

<li> Infer the relationships among classes (association, aggregation,
and composition) and accessors to create an idiom-level model of the
class files by clicking "AAC Relationships" in the "Tools" Panel.
You can control the level of details of the display through
the checkboxes available in the "Viewer Options" tab, on the
right-hand side.
</li>

<li> Select an antipattern to detect in the reverse-engineered model
by selecting the "Anti Patterns" tab, checking the appropriate
checkbox(es), and clicking "Detect Anti Patterns".
</li>

<li> Display the antipatterns found in the model either has red boxes
marking the appropriate classes or by selecting the "View Options"
tab and clicking the "List Similar Micro-architectures" button.
</li>
