We could look for method with public/protected process-oriented methods,
being called in a class/abstract class, then the classes are all
functional decompositions. If the methods are private, then the class
itself is a Functional Decompositon? But we should remove UI-related
classes, with their "init"...
Distinguish Functional Decompositions and Singletons and Applets and
buffer/output-like classes.
